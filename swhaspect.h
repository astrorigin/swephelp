/** @brief Aspect matching - aspect in range [0;360[
 *
 * Check if the two given positions match the aspect within the given orb.
 *
 * This also calculates the difference between targeted aspect and objects
 * distance (so that pos0 + asp + diffret = pos2), and its speed (so that
 * a negative speed indicates an applying aspect). Returned factor simply
 * is that difference expressed in orb units (so that orb * facret = diffret).
 *
 * If you are not interested in that mumbo-jumbo, just set objects speeds to
 * zero, and consider only the value returned by the function.
 *
 * @param pos0 First object longitude, in degrees [0;360[
 * @param speed0 First object longitude speed, in degrees per day
 * @param pos1 Second object longitude, in degrees [0;360[
 * @param speed1 Second object longitude speed, in degrees per day
 * @param aspect Aspect targeted, in degrees [0;360[
 * @param orb Orb allowed, in degrees
 * @param diffret Difference between aspect and objects distance, in degrees
 * @param speedret Difference speed, in degrees per day
 * @param facret Difference expressed in orb units
