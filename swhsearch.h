** retrogradation time (tested from 1.1.-3000 to 1.1.3000 when possible).
**
** @remarks May return 10 (default) if the planet is not implemented.
** This may be the case if you want some unusual asteroid. If you need to
** speed search routines, you may try to compute the retrogradation time
** using the minretro.py script, add one line to the source code, and recompile.
**
** @todo Implement more planets, main asteroids...
