/** @brief Calculate Halbronn's "Saturn 4 Stars" index value
**  @param jd Julian day UT
**  @param flag Calculation flags, see Swisseph docs
**  @param ret Array for 6 double (longitude of Sat, Ald, Reg, Ant, Fom, and index value)
**  @param err Buffer for error, declared as char[256]
**  @return 0 on success, else -1
**
**  This is an attempt at defining an "index value" based on Jacques Halbronn's
**  theory, known as the "Saturn 4 stars" system, or "Astrocyclon", or "Central
**  Astrology", etc.
**
**  The returned value (the index) represents, for a given time, the visual
**  proximity of Saturn regarding its cycle along the path marked by the royal stars.
**  The nearer of the stars Saturn is found, closer to 100 the index value is.
**  Also, the index value is zero (0) exactly when saturn is at mid-point between
**  the two nearest stars.
